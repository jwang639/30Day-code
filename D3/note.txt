- NaN means not a number, but the type of NaN is number. NaN is not equal to NaN or any number

- Operator ** means exponential

- pre-increment: ++i VS post-increment: i++
    pre means increase by 1 firstly and use the value; post mean you use the current value of i, then increase by 1

-  Ternary Operators allows you to write a condition, memorize the syntax below:
    
    let number = 5
        number > 0
        ? console.log(`${number} is a positive number`)
        : console.log(`${number} is a negative number`)
        number = -5

        number > 0
        ? console.log(`${number} is a positive number`)
        : console.log(`${number} is a negative number`)
    ****out put: 5 is a positive number******
               5 is a negative number
