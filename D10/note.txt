- create a set from array
const companies = new Set(array)

- Set is iterable

- set.add(), set.delete()

- check element in set
set.has()

- clear the set
set.clear()

- Since each element is unique is set, we can use it to count how many kind of items in an array

- To find a union to two sets can be achieved using spread operator.
let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
let b = [3, 4, 5, 6]
let c = [...a, ...b]

- use filter() and has() can get the intersection of two sets
