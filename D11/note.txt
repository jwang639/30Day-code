- Destructing Arrays, unpack {arrays, and objects} and assigning to a distinct variable

- If we like to skip on of the values in the array we use additional comma.
    const numbers = [1, 2, 3]
    let [numOne, , numThree] = numbers //2 is omitted

- spread operator(...)
We can not assign variable to all the elements in the array, can get the remaining as array using spread operator(...)
