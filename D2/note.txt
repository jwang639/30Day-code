- Primitive data(not modifiable) types are compared by its values. 

- Non-primitive data types are modifiable or mutable, do not compare non-primitive data types(arrays, objects, etc)

- Math Object:
    * console.log(Math.round(PI))                // 3 to round values to the nearest number
    * console.log(Math.round(9.81))              // 10
    * console.log(Math.floor(PI))                // 3 rounding down
    * console.log(Math.ceil(PI))                 // 4 rounding up
    * const randNum = Math.random() // creates random number between 0 to 0.999999

- Strings:  
    * If the string length is too big it does not fit in one line, We can use the backslash character (\) 
    at the end of each line to indicate that the string will continue on the next line
    * Escape Sequences in Strings, \n: new line, \t: Tab, means 8 spaces

- Template Literals (Template Strings): `String literal text ${expression}`
    let a = 2
    let b = 3
    console.log(`The sum of ${a} and ${b} is ${a + b}`) 

    let c = 2
    let d = 3
    console.log(`${c} is greater than ${d}: ${c > d}`)


- String has a lot of properties, string.concat(), string.includes(), etc

- Data Type Casting:
    String to Int: parseInt(), Number()

- Remember how to use regular expression! it is really useful with using replace() or match()
    check the regex cheat sheet if forgot
